The code in this directory contains short introductory examples of using POSIX system and C library calls. 
The emphasis is on brevity and simplicity rather than well-documented, robust, production-quality code. 
For example, restarts and error handling are typically omitted.

Most examples can be directly compiled using gcc or llvm.

gcc -o hello hello.c
